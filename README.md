MCFlashCards
===========

Multiple Choice Flashcards.  This program is useful for memorizing lots of things.  You can set the program
to ask questions and provide multiple choice answers or provide answers and choose the correct question.

The questions are ordered such that after learning the first 4 items, only 2 new items are added at a time.
This way, the most recently learned questions are repeated very shortly after learning them to reinforce
the learned item.  Try it out and see how it works.

The data is easily entered using a CSV format which can be created using EXcel.  See the example 
items in the Release folder.
