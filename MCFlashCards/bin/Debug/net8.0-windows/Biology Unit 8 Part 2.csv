What is speciation?,the process of forming a new species from a species already in existence,"The process by which organisms adapt to their environment","The process of gene flow between populations","The random change in allele frequencies over time"

What is behavioral isolation?,When two populations become separated by difference in courtship rituals or other behaviors,"When populations are separated by a physical barrier","When populations are separated by different breeding seasons","When populations are separated by ecological niches"
